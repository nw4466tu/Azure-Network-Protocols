<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines (Cont.)</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this repository, we're going to look at the data traveling back and forth between two virtual machines using Azure. We'll use simple tools like Wireshark and PowerShell to watch and understand how everything works. As well as expiriment with Network Security Groups (NSGs).
<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell</b> 
- <b>WireShark</b>
- <b>Remote Desktop</b>
- <b>Various Netork Protocols (SSH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- <b>Microsoft Azure

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)
- <b>Linux Ubuntu</b> x64(Gen2)

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

<p>
This is a cotinued lab from my other repository "VM Connection Lab", but in this one we are going to utilize tools like Powershell and Wireshark to read traffic between our two virtual machines using various different network protocols. 

After we connect to the Windows virtual machine, go to WireShark on the web and download it with default settings. This will allow us to observe traffic across various protocols.
